What exactly is version control for me ?

Version control is a system that helps me track changes in my project files over time.
It allows me to save different versions of my code, 
go back to previous stages, 
and see exactly what was changed and when.
For me, version control means safety, organization, and teamwork.
It protects my work from mistakes, keeps my project history clean, and makes collaboration easier 
by allowing multiple people to work on the same project without losing progress. 
Tools like Git and GitHub help me manage my project smoothly and maintain a proper 
development workflow.
